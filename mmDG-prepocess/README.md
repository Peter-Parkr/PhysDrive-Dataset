# Millimeter-Wave Data Preprocessing

This project is designed to process millimeter-wave data, focusing on data preprocessing (such as data segmentation and normalization) as well as the alignment of physiological data. The project includes the following key steps and scripts:

## Processing Workflow

1. **`main.py`**: Preprocesses millimeter-wave data, including data segmentation and normalization.
2. **`process_csv.py`**: Aligns physiological data with millimeter-wave data.
